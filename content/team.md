      Our team was structured into several smaller sub-teams with each on
      focused on a particular aspect of the development of the project. Members
      were allocated to teams based on a self-assessed skills matrix filled out
      in the first week. The project manager was responsible for making sure
      individual teams remained on schedule and co-ordinating tasks that
      required overlap between two teams such as code integration.


      The team initially communicated through Facebook Messenger but soon moved to Discord to allow independent communication between sub-teams to focus on their area of development, while at the same time allowing collaboration between teams to maximise cohesion and awareness of progress. This flexible approach allowed team members to stay focused on their own tasks or collaborate with another team as necessary. Throughout the development the team had two whole team meetings a week as well as smaller meetings between groups.


      The project code was storing in a shared repository on GitHub to allow the entire team access. Version control was implemeted through Git and GitHub, using GitHubâ€™s project management features to keep track of how the project was progressing. Demo reports were created using Overleaf, enabling instant visual feedback of layout and the ability for the team to add comments and feedback.
