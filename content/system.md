       Railly Clean is a train sanitising robot that clears and sanitises train tables while the train is out of transit to reduce the workload of cleaning staff Throughout the UK each year there are 1.7 billion passenger rail journeys Our vision is to augement the existing cleaning staff employed by rail operators with a robot workforce who would be able to speed up the process of cleaning and by reducing the number of repetetive tasks that cleaners have to carry out to allow them to deliver an improved passenger experience. Use cases? Once a train has finished its journeys for the day it needs to be cleaned.
