    content: >-
      Railly Clean clears and disinfects train carriage tables while out of transit to improve sanitation and overall passenger satisfaction on trains.


      During the Covid-19 pandemic, thorough cleaning of key touchpoints on trains has been increased, but we believe high standards of cleaning should be maintained beyond the pandemic. According to Scotrail’s Passenger Satisfaction Remedial Plan of 2019, even pre-pandemic, interior train cleanliness was deemed to be the second most important contributor to overall customer satisfaction. Even so, a National Rail Passenger Survey showed a dramatic decrease in interior cleanliness perceived by commuters from the 2017 to 2018 period. The key suggestion by the committee in order to improve this declining satisfaction, was to improve fleet cleanliness standards within core peak hours of operation. This is where we come in.


      Our robots are a one-time investment, costing only £614.95 each to manufacture. This is equivalent to just 69 hours of minimum wage work. As a Covid-19 Public Attitudes survey have revealed: 32% of Rail Operators have expressed concern that the pandemic will have a lasting effect on passenger numbers. 49% of people from the same survey say that they would rather travel by car than public transport even after restrictions are lifted. With increased focus on hygiene since the pandemic, investing in Railly Clean would provide reassurance to passengers that they will be safe as regular cleaning of carriages will continue post-pandemic, helping operators win back the trust of passengers.


      Railly Cleans wil be present on the platform and board trains at major stops with sufficient waiting times. While the train is stationary and free of passengers, multiple robots will be working efficiently together with a cleaner to clean train carriages just before passengers start to board. A single member of staff is required to place accessible ramps at each carriage, allowing each Railly Clean to navigate into its carriage ready to clean tables. Once Railly clean has finished its run, a cleaner can quickly walk down the carriages picking up minimal leftover rubbish or collecting valuables left by passengers which Railly Clean has intelligently avoided cleaning.

    title: Use Cases
    content: >-
        ### Use Case 1

        Speedy Trains is a train operator with a long-haul train from London Euston to Edinburgh Waverly. This is a regular, in demand service so the same train will make the journey there and back in a day. In Edinburgh there is a 30-minute gap between the train arriving and starting its return journey. Speedy Trains wants to use this opportunity to clean the train at the changeover by clearing any rubbish and also disinfecting key touch points including tables and door buttons. A cleaner can wait on the platform where the train arrives, together with all the robots in place where carriage doors expect to be lined up. Once the train arrives and the passengers have disembarked, a member of a staff will quickly place down an accessible ramp at each carriage. The robots then can be powered on to navigate into their respective carriages and proceed to remove rubbish and disinfect buttons and tables. After they have completed their cleaning and left the carriage, only one cleaner is required to board the train and pick up any valuable the robots have avoided cleaning, or any open cans the robots cannot sweep. The accessibility ramps can be quickly collected, and the train is cleaned and ready to go.


        ### Use Case 2

        L.F.Trains is a train operator who wants to deep-clean trains at night more frequently to keep customers happy. To achieve this, they want to deploy a number of robots to augment their cleaning staff, allowing faster, more thorough cleaning while minimising viral exposure to the staff. Like in the case above, a cleaner will wait with the robots at the platform. Once accessible ramps are set up, the robots will navigate into the carriages after being powered on, disinfect door buttons and tables, then navigate off the train by themselves. A cleaner can then pick up all the valuables and open cans the robots is not expected to handle. The accessible ramps can then be collected.
