      Railly Clean is an autonomous train cleaning solution. 


      The robot can be moved up a ramp and onto the train. Once in the carriage it will centre itself using the stickers. It moves forward through the carriage, using the distance sensors on the side to detect tables. Upon reaching a table the robot moves into position to begin wiping as well as opening its bin compartment. Before each wipe it assesses whether there are any valuables in the way, if there are then it avoids that section of the table. If there is only rubbish in the way then the robot will wipe the table, using a sponge attached to the end of the arm to clean the table, while pulling rubbish towards it and into it’s integrated bin compartment. Once a table has been cleaned the robot reverts back to the state where it’s looking for tables and finding and cleaning them as it goes. Once it reaches the end of the carriage it will turn around and clean the tables on the other side of the carriage. Once all the tables have been cleaned and the robot has reached the end of the carriage it uses its camera to detect the button and cleans and presses it
